# AI Policy

This document describes the AI policy for the Spegel project inspired by the policy in [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/blob/main/AI_POLICY.md).

Spegel is a project that is built and maintained by humans. LLMs are able to generate text that may look correct, at a pace few humans can keep up with. This tends to result in long-winded responses that take a lot more time to read and respond to, that may not even be factually correct in the first place. All communication in pull requests and issues from project maintainers are written by humans. For the same reason it is expected that all communication on the other end is also written by humans.

All PRs created with the help of an LLM should be clearly stated. You are expected to disclose the model used and to what extent it was used to generate the code. Any changes made without a human in the loop are explicitly forbidden. You are still expected to take responsibility for the changes that you submit which is not possible with human involvement.

Please follow these rules and respect the time and energy of the people who work on Spegel.
