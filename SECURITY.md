# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The latest minor release of Spegel receives patch updates for critical security vulnerabilities on a best-effort basis.

For guaranteed SLAs on security fixes and patches across multiple releases, enterprise support is available through [Kvick](https://kvick.dev).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/spegel-org/spegel/security/advisories/new). All reports are handled with priority.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 7 days and release patches for critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

We request that security researchers follow responsible disclosure practices and allow us a reasonable time of 90 days to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.

With your permission, we will acknowledge your contribution in the release notes of the patch version.
